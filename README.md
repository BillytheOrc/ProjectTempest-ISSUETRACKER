> JapanLady: TL;DR - Good server, you will claw your eyes out from the amazing quality! :^)

### About Us

We are a passion project with a long history of World of Warcraft emulation development,
dating back to 2010 and ArcEmu-based cores.

The [server](http://project-tempest.com/) is hosted in North America, while your feedback can reach us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/8YuWsRr).

Originally, goal of the Project was to be a 2.4.3 PTE environment (starting with Vanilla content), however,
the community demand for a _high quality_ TBC-centric server shifted our development focus to post-Vanilla features.

We strive to provide near-blizzlike in-game experience, with bits of important but sane changes that contribute to the overall picture.

Our team consists of three dedicated people:
- **Herms**, head of PR and our main financial support
- **JapanLady**, the person behind core additions, fixes, tweaks and serious ass-whooping aka "Project lead"
- **The SQL ~~Slave~~ Snail**, yes -- that would be me, the Narrator. Let's [never](https://github.com/me-shaon/GLWTPL) talk about it again

> If all goes well, we are going to release at **July 31st, 2018** :3

### Features

- WoW TBC PvE (with sure meaty bites of PvP) Not-So-Blizzlike server based on...
- ... on [CMaNGOS](https://github.com/cmangos) project! Just generously spiced with large amount of custom fixes and tweaks
- Meticiously polished server scripting of whatever our hands could reach for, because every little detail matters
- Progressive content based on 2.4.3.8606 client, starting with patch 2.0
- Hand-tuned heroic dungeons and raid encounters
- Before release-day our rates are:
  - x3 for XP
  - -25% XP requirement for levels 1 through 57
  - x1.2 rates on reputation gains
  - Craft chances are adjusted to 50% for green, 75% for yellow and 100% for orange levels
- ...and after release day:
  - We'll begin by opening first TBC Dungeons like Hellfire Ramparts
  - Once the population will start to hit level 70, we'll be providing T4 content starting from Karazhan up to Gruul's Lair
  - Content will be gated via dungeon keys that require being revered rather than honored with respective factions
  - Starting mounts will require level 40 (Warlock & Paladin mounts included), but the price won't be changed
  - In-game economy will be stimulated through increased use of professions, in dungeons as well.

> This above means that, while more difficult, encounters won't be _impossible_ while offering fair and balanced gameplay to our playerbase.
